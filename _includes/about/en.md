> Hack Player The Box - Cybersecurity Enthusiast - Telematics at the USM

I am a student of the Technical University Federico Santa Maria, of the Civil Engineering degree in Telematics. I am currently 19 years old and I am from Chile, from Villa Alemana.

I like Cybersecurity and learn, I make this website as a way to save each command and write up so I can have a backup and read the development of challenges and machines of the HackTheBox platform.

As a student, I am willing to learn and improve, if you have doubts you can contact me and if you think I have done something wrong or find something that I am missing, do not hesitate to let me know so I can improve and learn much more.

You can not only find information about HackTheBox, but some other write ups or things that I will be doing over time, so there will be a lot of information you can use.

 Â¡Happy Hacking!...
